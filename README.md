# 42 C Piscine Projects

This README file serves as an overview of the 42 C Piscine Projects. These projects were completed during a 4-week intensive program aimed at teaching the fundamentals of the C programming language. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of C programming, building upon the knowledge and skills gained in the previous projects.

## Projects

The following is a list of the projects completed during the 42 C Piscine, in the order they were completed:

1. **Rush 00**: In this project, we created a program that generates a square or rectangle made up of characters, based on user input.

2. **Rush 01**: Refer to Skyscraper Project

3. **Exam Rank 02**: In this project, we completed a mock exam to prepare for the actual exam at the end of the Piscine.

4. **Push_swap**: In this project, we created a program that sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of operations.

5. **C Piscine Final Exam**: In this project, we completed the final exam for the C Piscine.

## Knowledge Learned

Throughout the Piscine, we gained knowledge and skills in the following areas of C programming, in the following order:

1. **Data Types (Bytes)**: We learned about the different data types in C, including integers, floats, and characters, and how they are stored in memory as bytes.

2. **Pointers**: We learned about pointers, which allow us to manipulate the memory directly, and how to use them to pass variables by reference.

3. **String Manipulation**: We learned how to manipulate strings in C, including concatenation, copying, and searching.

4. **Base Conversion**: We learned how to convert between different number bases, including decimal, hexadecimal, and binary.

5. **Command Line Arguments**: We learned how to pass arguments to a C program through the command line, and how to parse and use them.

6. **Memory Allocation**: We learned about memory allocation in C, including dynamic memory allocation using malloc, calloc, and realloc.

7. **Recursion**: We learned about recursion, and how to use it to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems.

8. **Headers**: We learned about headers, and how to use them to organize our code and make it more modular.

9. **Makefile**: We learned how to use Makefiles to automate the building and compiling of our programs.

10. **Linked List**: We learned about linked lists, and how to use them to create dynamic data structures in C.
